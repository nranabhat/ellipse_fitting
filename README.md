# Fitting Data from Atomic Clock Experiments
# Abstract 
The precision and accuracy of atomic clocks has increased rapidly over the past
decade, leading to improvements in technologies such as gravity gradiometers and
GPS. However, in some cases, the methods of extracting information from optical
atomic clock comparisons are imperfect and can be improved. This work introduces
two methods for fitting elliptical data obtained from atomic clock experiments: a
neural network and a maximum likelihood estimate. Despite extensive training,
the neural network falls short of outperforming the current least-squares method.
On the other hand, when given enough data, the maximum likelihood estimate is
shown to produce more accurate fits than the least-squares method.
